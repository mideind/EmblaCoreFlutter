# EmblaCore

EmblaCore is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) library containing the core session
functionality in [Embla](https://github.com/mideind/EmblaFlutterApp), a cross-platform
mobile Icelandic-language voice assistant client. EmblaCore requires Flutter >= 2.17.

## Installation

Add this to the dependencies list in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
  embla_core: ">=1.0.0"
```

and then run the following command from the project root:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Documentation

Extensive `dartdoc` documentation is [available here](https://embla.is/embla_core).

## Demo App

A simple demo app that demonstrates how to use EmblaCore can viewed at
[`example/lib/main.dart`](https://github.com/mideind/EmblaCoreFlutter/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart).

To run the demo app, you must acquire an API key from [Mideind](https://mideind.is) and add
it in the file `example/lib/main.dart`. Then run the following command from the repo root:

```bash
cd example
flutter run -d [your_device_id]
```

## Basic API usage

```dart
import 'package:embla_core/embla_core.dart';

...

var config = EmblaConfig();

/* Set properties of config object... */

var session = EmblaSession(config=config);

session.start();

...

session.cancel();
```
